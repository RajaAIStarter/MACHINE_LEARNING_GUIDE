Linear regression is a regression algorithm used to predict continuous values. It's one of the simplest and most interpretable models in machine learning, making it a great starting point for understanding regression concepts.
Key Idea:

Linear regression assumes a linear relationship between the features (x) and the target (y). It tries to model this relationship using the equation:
y=mx+b
y=mx+b

Here:

    mm: The slope or weight, which determines the rate of change in yy for a unit change in xx.
    bb: The intercept, which represents the value of yy when x=0x=0.

The goal of the model is to find the best fit line that minimizes the error between the predicted values (y^y^​) and the actual values (yy).
How Does It Work?

    Finding the Best Fit Line:
        The model needs to determine the values of mm (slope) and bb (intercept) such that the line best represents the relationship between the features and target.
        This is done by minimizing the error between the predicted and actual values.

    Gradient Descent:
        The optimization process uses gradient descent to iteratively update the values of mm and bb.
        Gradient descent works by calculating the gradient (or slope of the error curve) with respect to the parameters and moving in the direction that reduces the error.
        The learning rate determines how large each step is during the optimization process. A small learning rate makes convergence slow, while a large one might overshoot the optimal solution.

    Cost Function:
        To quantify the error, we use a cost function, such as Mean Squared Error (MSE):
        MSE=1n∑i=1n(y^i−yi)2
        MSE=n1​i=1∑n​(y^​i​−yi​)2
            nn: Number of data points.
            y^iy^​i​: Predicted value for the ii-th data point.
            yiyi​: Actual value for the ii-th data point.
        The goal is to minimize this cost function during training. A smaller error indicates a better fit.

Evaluation Metrics:

After training the model, we evaluate its performance using metrics such as:

    Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measures the average squared error between predictions and actual values. Smaller is better(depends on target values).
    Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): The square root of MSE, making the error interpretable in the same units as the target.
    Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Measures the average absolute difference between predictions and actual values. It is less sensitive to outliers than MSE.
    R2R2 (Coefficient of Determination): Explains the proportion of variance in the target that is predictable from the features. Values close to 1 indicate a good fit.

Key Points to Note:

    Assumptions of Linear Regression:
        There is a linear relationship between the features and the target.
        Errors are normally distributed and independent.
        Features are not highly correlated with each other (no multicollinearity).

    When to Use Linear Regression:
        Works well for smaller datasets with linear relationships.
        Ideal when interpretability is crucial (e.g., understanding feature importance through weights).

    Limitations:
        Struggles with non-linear relationships.
        Sensitive to outliers, as they can significantly affect the slope (mm).
