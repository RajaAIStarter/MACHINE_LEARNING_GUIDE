Ridge and Lasso Regression: A Detailed Explanation
Understanding Ridge and Lasso Regression

Linear regression is a fundamental algorithm used to predict continuous values by finding the best-fit line for the given data. However, it can suffer from overfitting when the dataset has many features or multicollinearity among them. Ridge and Lasso regression address these issues by introducing regularization, which penalizes large coefficient values, helping to improve model generalization.
Linear Regression:

    Objective: Minimize the Residual Sum of Squares (RSS).
    Drawback: No penalty for large coefficients, which can lead to overfitting in high-dimensional data.

Ridge Regression:

    Objective: Minimize RSS with an additional penalty term:

    Objective: Minimize RSS + λ * Σ(β_i^2)

    where:
        λ is the regularization parameter (alpha in scikit-learn).
        β_i are the model coefficients.
    Effect: Shrinks coefficients towards zero but never eliminates them. Useful when all features are important but need regularization.
    Key Point: Ridge does not perform feature selection; it retains all features with reduced impact.

Lasso Regression:

    Objective: Minimize RSS with an additional penalty term:

    Objective: Minimize RSS + λ * Σ|β_i|

    where:
        λ is the regularization parameter.
        |β_i| is the absolute value of the coefficients.
    Effect: Shrinks some coefficients to exactly zero, effectively eliminating less important features.
    Key Point: Lasso is useful for feature selection in addition to regularization.

Dataset and Libraries:
Python

from sklearn.datasets import load_diabetes
from sklearn.linear_model import RidgeCV, Ridge, LassoCV, Lasso, LinearRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

Dataset Preparation:
Python

# Load the diabetes dataset
diabetes = load_diabetes()
X, y = diabetes.data, diabetes.target
df = pd.DataFrame(X, columns=diabetes.feature_names)
df['target'] = y

# Split the data into training and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

Linear Regression:  

Python

linear_model = LinearRegression()
linear_model.fit(X_train, y_train)
linear_score = linear_model.score(X_test, y_test)
linear_mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, linear_model.predict(X_test))

Ridge Regression (α=0):
Python

ridge_model_ols = Ridge(alpha=0)
ridge_model_ols.fit(X_train, y_train)
ridge_ols_score = ridge_model_ols.score(X_test, y_test)
ridge_ols_mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, ridge_model_ols.predict(X_test))

Ridge Regression with Cross-Validation:
Python

ridge_cv = RidgeCV(alphas=np.logspace(-3, 3, 7), cv=5)
ridge_cv.fit(X_train, y_train)
best_alpha_ridge = ridge_cv.alpha_
ridge_model = Ridge(alpha=best_alpha_ridge)
ridge_model.fit(X_train, y_train)
ridge_score = ridge_model.score(X_test, y_test)
ridge_mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, ridge_model.predict(X_test))

Lasso Regression (α=0):
Python

lasso_alpha_0 = Lasso(alpha=0, max_iter=10000)
lasso_alpha_0.fit(X_train, y_train)
lasso_alpha_0_score = lasso_alpha_0.score(X_test, y_test)
lasso_alpha_0_mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, lasso_alpha_0.predict(X_test))

Lasso Regression with Cross-Validation:
Python

lasso_cv = LassoCV(alphas=np.logspace(-3, 3, 7), cv=5)
lasso_cv.fit(X_train, y_train)
best_alpha_lasso = lasso_cv.alpha_
lasso_model = Lasso(alpha=best_alpha_lasso)
lasso_model.fit(X_train, y_train)
lasso_score = lasso_model.score(X_test, y_test)
lasso_mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, lasso_model.predict(X_test))

Key Takeaways:

    Linear Regression is simple but prone to overfitting in high-dimensional data.
    Ridge Regression reduces overfitting but retains all features with smaller coefficients.
    Lasso Regression reduces overfitting and performs feature selection by eliminating irrelevant features.
    Visualizations help understand the impact of regularization on model performance and coefficients.
